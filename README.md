# SantaGame

A Blueprint only VR game about Santa who is choosing last presents before christmas eve.

At first it was a game for [Epic Mega Jam](https://itch.io/jam/2020-epic-megajam) that I started with my friends. The topic was "It's been a Long Time But We Are Not Done Yet". I ended up making the game mostly myself. Obviously I failed gamejam deadline, so i decided to finish this game to make it present for my family. I though it would be cool if Santa would choose thier presents in front of them in VR. 

The game loop is simple:
- Choose a letter on the table
- Read it
- Estimate how good was person this year, what present would fit best for him/her.
- Choose a present from a pile
- Send it
- Get high score if you guessed with presend and low if not
